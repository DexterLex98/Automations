# Automations 

The whole point of this repository is to create automated scripts/binaries, that will cover our Pentest, assessment work much more eaiser, including our scanning to exporting of client data.


## Script List which is currently available

- urlfetcher.py: In Assessments we use Nessus which helps us generate *asset.csv* the `csv` report contains lots of shorten URLs that are handled by nessus itself, urlfetcher fetches the original url from those shortened URL's (ALPHA) 

- **NOTE: Based on the requirements I'll be adding more tools in here, according will be added in the README**
